# Automatically switches to AV in on start up
Handy for when you want your goggles to start up directly in AV IN mode without having to navigate the menu.

Note: Only works in the 'DJI Digital FPV System' mode.  Has no effect in O3 mode, since O3 mode has no AV in support.

Internally, it runs setprop dji.factory.avin_test 1 after boot.
